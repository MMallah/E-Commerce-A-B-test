# [Project 1: E-commerce A/B test](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MMallah/E-Commerce-A-B-test/blob/master/E-commerce%20A_B%20Test.ipynb)

A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who convert, meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

* After data wrangling, we calculate the average conversion rate for both the {old page} & {new page}.
* Then we test the conversion rate using the central limit therom after taking 10k samples.
* From the tests conducted, we summarize that we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis which stated that the old paage has better average conversion rate.
